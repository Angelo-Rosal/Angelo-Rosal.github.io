In my introduction to learning TypeScript, I found various interpretations and viewpoints that have me comparing it to other programming languages I have experienced with so far. So far, my coding experience has focused on Python, Java, C/C++ so learning TypeScript feels very fresh to me. The way TypeScript is structured provides a good and interesting challenge for me that I hope to overcome eventually. 

## How TypeScript Compares to Other Programming Languages

In the beginning I was stuck by how much TypeScript adds onto Java. TypeScript adds ‘types’ into Java making it more determined by the structure of the data. This sort of makes some code easier to create for me and makes it easier to visualize. Comparing it to Python, which is a dynamically typed language, TypeScript is a language that defines types upfront. Although Python is a simpler language, TypeScript’s parameters can be useful when dealing with larger projects where maintaining stability are critical. 

Compared to C/C++, TypeScript is less intimidating. C/C++ is a much more complex language that demands high knowledge about memory management and syntax, as in TypeScript it’s a cleaner and more modern language that appeals more to the newer developers. TypeScript also uses features provided by ES6. Features like arrow functions, restructuring, template literals, and its unique enhancements. Learning about this module not only deepened my understanding of the TypeScript language but also sharpened my knowledge of ES6. 

Personally, coming in with a software engineering perspective, TypeScript is a more solid choice to use compared to most programming languages. It’s easier to understand language, making it easier for collaboration and personal creation. TypeScript also has a lot of excellent tools that everyone can utilize. However, it does add an initial learning curve that coders need to overcome to fully utilize TypeScript to its maximum. Nonetheless, TypeScript just seems more worth it in compared to other languages.

## WODs and It’s Importance

One practice that was deemed useful well learning TypeScript was practice WODs. The practice WODs were designed to use real world problems and have us figure out code to solve them in a time crunch. I thought about how useful this practice is in the long run as doing it over and over again trying to shorten our completion time can drastically effect how well we can problem solve and remember code. Also due to the problems being real world problems we can expect these similar questions to be asked in interviews which will help us get future jobs and opportunities.
