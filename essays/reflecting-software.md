As ICS 314 comes to a close, I have been reflecting on not only about what I've learned about in class but more specifically what I learned about software engineering. While the development of Meteor-based apps was the course focus, the real value of this course for me was the learning of various software engineering principles that could be applied to any software project. For the purposes of this essay, I'd like to make special note of three ideas that struck me: Agile Project Management, Configuration Management, and Coding Standards. These aren't web app-centric—they're fundamental to any large-scale, team-oriented software development project.

## Agile Project Management and Issue Driven Project Management

One of the most valuable take-aways from ICS 314 was learning how to handle software projects in an Agile framework. Agile Project Management is a module-based approach in which teams create bite-sized chunks of functional software in short periods of time, referred to as sprints. The goal is to be flexible and continually improve based on user and team feedback.

In this scheme, we practiced a more defined methodology called **Issue Driven Project Management (IDPM)**. In IDPM, everything is broken down into small pieces of work called "issues." An issue is a feature, a bug fix, or an enhancement and is assigned to one developer. The beauty of this methodology is that it is very simple and transparent. You always know what you're working on, how it ties into the bigger picture, and who is working on what.

I found it really useful not just for our web development projects, but for group work altogether. I can definitely see how IDPM could be applied to non-software projects, i.e., organizing an event, completing a research paper as a group, or even task management for a game development project. The way it is structured puts everyone on the same page and responsible, and it is easily visible how much has been accomplished. 

## Configuration Management

Another concept that resonated with me was **Configuration Management (CM)**. Configuration management in software development refers to managing changes to code, documentation, and other assets in the project in a controlled manner so that all stays consistent and traceable over time. In our class, we studied CM predominantly using Git and GitHub. We were taught how to make branches, create pull requests, review others' code, and merge conflicts.

At first, it was intimidating—especially merging conflicts. But after getting used to it, I could see just how important this skill is. If you didn't have CM, working on a project would be in chaos and buggy. This isn't just useful with web development—any software project (desktop, mobile, embedded systems) needs good config management in order to scale properly.

CM also ensures transparency. You can always look at commit histories to understand who altered things, and when, and why. This is important in workspaces where quality assurance and responsibility are the way of the day. It's the very reason why software engineering is a discipline and a team sport.

## Coding Standards

Finally, we spent a significant amount of time following **Coding Standards**, specifically by using ESLint and code review tools. Coding standards are the guidelines developers follow to write easy to read code that could be changed at ease.. At first, some coding rules did feel a bit tedious, but before I knew it, I realized the advantages.

Having a consistent code style allows teams to more easily read, debug, and maintain code. It reduces cognitive load and avoids trivial errors. I also appreciated that many standards required good practice, e.g., not to use unused variables or to document functions properly.

This principle is crucial for any project with more than one person. It's like sharing the same language—if we all code differently, it makes it so much harder to work together. Whether I am developing a web app, a scholarly Python script, or even a Unity game, I know using unified coding standards will result in a better final product and easier maintainability overall.

## Conclusion

ICS 314 did more than just teach me how to create web applications. It gave me a practical introduction to the fundamental software engineering principles—principles that can be utilized in any technological project that I undertake in the future. Agile Project Management opened my eyes to how to break down work and work together. Configuration Management showed me the importance of version control and working together. Coding Standards taught me how important clarity and consistency are, as well as functionality.

With further studies and professional experience ahead of me, I have no doubt that these skills will be applied, whether I am writing web apps, programming scientific software, or designing research tools for marine biology. This course has actually laid the foundations for a career in software engineering.
