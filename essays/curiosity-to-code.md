## Curiosity to Code
The thought of coding something has fascinated me ever since I was born. I grew up watching various spy films and always admired how cool ‘hackers’ looked. I always wanted to be just like them and grew to have an interest in learning how to code. What I want to figure out currently is how to properly create software and be as cool as those 'hackers' I've always aspire to be. 

## Hopes

The skills I wish to acquire in the future is how to become and efficient intermediate software developer. First, I want to learn how to properly approach developing software. I will learn how to get familiar with the steps in creating software and every little detail that comes with it. Second, is how to effectively problem solve. Using the experiences I hope to go through, I can help further my problem-solving skills, especially solving how to fix various problems in the code and debug. Third, I want to be able to learn how to collaborate effectively in a team environment. I can achieve this through pushing to get out of my comfort zone and learn how to be an effective leader. Lastly, I want to learn how to figure out how to tackle interviews. The main pillar to overcome in this field is getting past an interview, as an interview will decide if you get the job or not. So, I hope to develop characteristics that a good interviewee has in order to appeal to the interviewer more than the rest.

## Summary 

It's through these few points and goals that I can achieve my 'hacker' status. I hope to achieve these through continuing my academic career as well as using resources given to me by UH Manoa. The problems I will face in class will not only make me smarter but stronger in confidently tackling these various coding problems. Also using the various resources given to me like the array of Computer Science clubs I can network and get experiences that will be important for my future.
