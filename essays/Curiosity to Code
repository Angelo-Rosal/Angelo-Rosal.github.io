Curiosity to Code
The thought of coding something has fascinated me ever since I was born. I grew up watching various spy films and always admired how cool ‘hackers’ looked. I always wanted to be just like them and grew to have an interest in learning how to code. What I wanted to figure out currently is how to properly create software, and I hope to be able to learn about that in this course. 

The skills I wish to acquire in this course is how to become and efficient intermediate software developer. First, I want to learn how to properly approach developing software. I want to be able to learn and get familiar with the steps in creating software. Second, is problem solving. Using the experiences I will learn in class can help further my problem-solving skills, especially solving how to fix various problems in the code. Third, I want to be able to learn how to collaborate effectively in a team environment. I can achieve this through pushing to get out of my comfort zone and learn how to be an effective leader. Lastly, I want to learn how to figure out how to tackle interviews. The main pillar to overcome in this field is getting past an interview, as an interview will decide if you get the job or not. So, I hope to develop characteristics that a good interviewee has in order to appeal to the interviewer more than the rest.
