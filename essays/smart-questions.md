You may think software developers just sit behind a computer and don't speak to anyone, but actually software developers often communicate to help each other succeed. I didn't realize how often I would need to communicate with others in this field and I wanted to improve this skill. In the essay written by Eric S. Raymond called "How to Ask Questions The Smart Way" I was able to learn about how to effectively ask technical questions to other people in the tech field that will help me in my communication as well as to increase my likelihood of receiving a useful response. 

## Smart Questions

Smart questions as said previously is an important skill for a software developer to have. For example we can use 'Stack Overflow' to help us connect with other developers. Stack Overflow gives us a hub where we can ask for help with programming issues, common problems, learning new concepts, and sharing knowledge in the community. It is a very safe and professional environment that focuses on keeping good questions and responses that will be helpful to the community. So learning how to give a Smart Question would be essential in this site. Smart questions are important in that it clearly states your problem to others so that they can effectively help solve your problem hitting everything that you need to succeed. 

## Example of Smart Question

Question: 

Why is processing a sorted array faster than processing an unsorted array?

In this question the user asks the community for help in figuring out why his code processed faster using a sorted array and not an unsorted array. 

This post clearly stated his need even providing examples and data to back up his claim. Also the user included his thoughts trying to figure out the problem and possibly a line in his code he thought was the problem. The users neatness and amount of info included helped the community boost the popularity of the question, as reflected in the high number of upvotes and answers given to the user. 

Response: 

As said above there was many responses but one response I found interesting was certain metaphors that a user gave that would help us visualize his problem. The answer he gave was to visualize a railroad junction. He wanted the viewers to visualize being a bling operator with no radio communication. Trains take a while to start up and slow down. We hear a train coming but has no idea where it is coming from. We can choose either to keep going or to stop. The metaphor he is making is that if you guessed right the train will continue but if you guessed wrong the driver will stop and back up making the process longer. So the connection is that if the array is sorted already then the process will continue, on the other hand if it is unsorted then it would have to stop and redo everything again. 

## Example of Not Smart Question

Question: 

Help!!! My code doesn't work!

In this question written as an example by ChatGPT we are given a question asking why his code does not work. This violates the essence of a Smart question as in this question we are given code and just asking the community why it does not work. It lacks a problem description just saying it does not work. There is also no evidence of using any other research before posting the question. They also demand urgency and for a private response. This shows a lack of empathy and research needed in order to post a good smart question. 

## Summary

Smart questions are essential for every software developer to use. Asking smart questions and not dumb questions can distinguish you from a bad software developer to a good one. By analyzing the two examples above we can deduce how important and useful asking smart questions are. It's through this practice I can comfortably express my needs and expect to get good responses that would help me further my knowledge of the software world.
