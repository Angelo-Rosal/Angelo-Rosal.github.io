As me and my group finish our Final Project for ICS 314, we get introduced to effort estimation and tracking. Here are my thoughts on this method. 

## Reflection

For this project, we used GitHub Project Tracker, a tool integrated into GitHub that allows teams to manage and assign tasks while also creating effort estimations. We also used a shared Google Spreadsheet to complement this tool and bring all our information into a single, centralized location. This combination of tools made it much easier to plan, track, and communicate throughout the project.

By documenting our tasks and assigning effort estimates, we were able to manage our time more efficiently and keep each other accountable. Even though some of our estimates ended up being inaccurate—sometimes way off—they still gave us a reference point to guide our workflow. This process kept us mentally prepared for the scope of the work and allowed us to adjust our approach when things took longer than expected. It also gave us an early warning system: when we saw tasks taking longer than estimated, we knew to re-prioritize or reach out for help.

## My Thoughts

In my opinion, effort estimation and tracking is a practice that should be used in every group project—whether it's for coding, writing, or even organizing events. One of the key benefits is that it forces the team to break down larger goals into smaller, manageable tasks. This helps in visualizing the overall workload and prevents the common mistake of underestimating how long things will take.

Well-organized task tracking also allows the team to identify possible roadblocks before they become major problems. It encourages team members to think critically about dependencies—what tasks need to be completed before others can begin—and makes it easier to adjust the plan if someone gets stuck or falls behind.

Another benefit of effort tracking is the ability to assign tasks strategically. Our group used the tools not just to split up the work, but to match tasks with each member’s strengths and availability. This helped avoid duplicate work and ensured a fair distribution of responsibilities. It also gave everyone a sense of ownership over their contributions, which helped keep morale high.

Of course, tracking effort isn't without its challenges. Sometimes it felt tedious to log hours or estimate effort when we just wanted to dive into coding. But in hindsight, those few extra minutes of planning saved us hours of confusion and rework. It also helped us better understand our own working habits—some of us realized we were faster at debugging, while others were more efficient at UI design or writing documentation.

## Final Thoughts

Overall, using tools like GitHub Project Tracker and effort estimation methods helped transform our workflow. What started as a simple checklist evolved into a dynamic, transparent system that made our collaboration stronger. Even though it wasn’t perfect, and our estimates weren’t always right, the process gave us structure, clarity, and a shared sense of direction. I would definitely recommend incorporating this approach into any future team projects.
