As me and my group finish our Final Project for ICS 314 we get introduced to effort estimation and tracking. Here are my thoughts on this method. 

## Reflection

For this project we used GitHub project tracker, a tool used in GitHub to manage and assign tasks and create effort estimations. We also used a Google spread sheet in order to further our organization and place everything onto one solid page. Using these resources we were able to put together our thoughts and track others progress on our project. This was really useful to our time management and helped us be successful in making deadlines. Even though we created effort estimates in advance and sometimes the estimates were off, these tools helped us keep our head in track and helped us prepare for the amount of work we were expected to do.

## My Thoughts

In my opinion, this method should be used in every project coding related or anything else. Creating in advanced project estimates helps us visualize the task at hand. Well organizing our task we also can look towards potential problems that we might run into and add on more task that should be looked at. Also using these tools we were able to assign members. This is crustal so that no overlap happens and keeps our project organized. We can also use this tool to spread the work so that everyone is able to tackle enough work for their capabilities.
