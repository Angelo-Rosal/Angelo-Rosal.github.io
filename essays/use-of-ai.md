# I. Introduction

AI has become more and more of an integral learning resource in education, especially in classes like Software Engineering where problem-solving, coding, and writing documentation are central. In ICS 314, I could integrate AI tools into my own learning process. I employed ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot when I needed them. They were employed for various purposes. From debugging code, to documenting, to teaching me new things. Throughout the course, AI was a resource that, when used judiciously, enhanced my productivity and deepened my understanding of software engineering principles.


# II. Personal Experience with AI

**Experience WODs (e.g., E18)** 
For the E18 WOD, which involved functional programming using Underscore.js, I used ChatGPT by prompting, “Write a JavaScript function using _.filter to extract all even numbers from a list.” AI gave me a helpful starting point. However, I still had to tweak the code to match the specific assignment instructions. The benefit was getting unstuck quickly, but the cost was needing to critically evaluate and adjust the solution rather than just copying it.

**In-class Practice WODs** 
During and after the practice wods I was able to utilize AI to practice similar problems. For example, using the Practice WOD's I was able to ask ChatGPT to summarize and create a practice problems. This helped build familiarity before class, although I avoided using AI during the actual WODs to simulate real-time coding under pressure.

**In-class WODs** 
I did not actively use AI during in-class WODs because of time constraints and the emphasis on practicing coding independently under timed conditions. I wanted to rely on my own knowledge during these sessions to build real-world coding stamina.

**Essays** 
For essays like this one, I used ChatGPT to brainstorm outlines and phrasing. For instance, I asked, "Help me create a structured reflection on using AI in a software engineering course." AI helped organize my thoughts but I heavily edited the drafts to maintain my own voice.

**Final Project** 
During the final project, I used GitHub Copilot inside VS Code for repetitive code writing. I also asked ChatGPT, "How to implement a collection with schema validation in Meteor.js?" It provided basic scaffolding, but integrating it into our full-stack app required substantial manual adjustments.

**Learning a concept / tutorial** 
When learning about hard topics in class, I asked ChatGPT for further explination. This was extremely helpful to grasp the abstract concept before diving into coding examples.

**Answering a question in class or in Discord** 
When someone asked about fixing an ESLint error, I used ChatGPT to simulate the error and find a quick solution by asking, "Why does ESLint give unexpected console statement error?" It provided both the explanation and the fix (disabling the rule or removing console.log).

**Asking or answering a smart-question** 
Before asking a question on Discord about performance issues, I first asked ChatGPT for help. This helped me ask a more targeted and smarter question on Discord.

**Coding example (e.g., using Underscore _.pluck)** 
I did not use AI for this coding example. As during studying I found online resources to be easier to understand.

**Explaining code** 
When documenting parts of my codebase for the final project, I asked ChatGPT, "Explain what this function does in simple terms," and pasted snippets. It helped me write better documentation comments for teammates.

**Writing code** 
AI helped me especially when setting up validation in forms. However, I still had to debug and modify it to fit our use case. AI made starting faster, but it never replaced needing to understand the framework deeply.

**Documenting code** 
GitHub Copilot often suggested auto-generated comments when I wrote functions. While sometimes generic, it saved time by giving a draft comment that I could then customize for clarity and accuracy.

**Quality assurance** 
When fixing ESLint errors, I copied snippets into ChatGPT with prompts like "Fix the ESLint 'no-unused-vars' error in this code." It was quick and very effective. However, I had to double-check the fixes to ensure they did not change the logic of my program.

**Other uses** 
Occasionally, when stuck, I would ask ChatGPT to give test cases for a function I wrote, prompting, "Generate basic and edge test cases for a JavaScript function that reverses strings." This was helpful for thinking more rigorously about code robustness.

# III. Impact on Learning and Understanding

Using AI in ICS 314 greatly impacted my learning experience. It allowed me to approach problems with an extra layer of support, especially when I was stuck. Instead of feeling frustrated, I could quickly get hints or see examples that refreshed my understanding. However, relying too much on AI early on sometimes made me overlook deeper documentation, so I had to strike a balance between using AI as a helper and still digging into primary sources.

# IV. Practical Applications

Outside of ICS 314, I have also used AI for projects like the HACC hackathon. For example, when building a web app with React, I asked ChatGPT, "Best way to implement a responsive navbar in React Bootstrap." It provided ideas quickly, which helped speed up development in a high-pressure environment. In real-world projects, AI feels like having an experienced coding partner—but still requires careful verification.

# V. Challenges and Opportunities

One major challenge was that AI sometimes gave incomplete or outdated information, especially for niche or updated libraries. Furthermore, it's easy to misuse AI by being slothful and duplicating code one doesn't comprehend. But there are great opportunities to use AI more in education—like teaching students to critically evaluate AI-generated solutions, instead of uncritically accepting them.

# VI. Comparative Analysis

Compared to traditional methods like reading textbooks or relying solely on lectures, AI offered much more instant feedback and allowed me to learn by doing. It made learning more dynamic and interactive. However, traditional methods provided a stronger foundation and deeper theoretical understanding. In my opinion, combining both methods creates the best learning environment.

# VII. Future Considerations

In the future, I believe AI will become an even larger part of software engineering education. Tools could become smarter, giving even more context-aware help. However, educators should emphasize ethical AI use, critical thinking, and balancing AI assistance with fundamental understanding.

# VIII. Conclusion

Overall, my experience using AI in ICS 314 has been very positive. AI helped me accelerate learning, debug problems, and document work more efficiently. However, it also taught me the importance of verifying information and not becoming over-reliant. Thoughtful integration of AI into education can make learning software engineering more accessible, engaging, and powerful.
