To your typical software engineer you might think you should code how you seem fit. Although it may seem ethical for you to that, when you look at it in a collaborative state you should follow somewhat of a 'coding standard' in order to make your code more readable, accessible, and efficient. Coding standards can also provide a useful education tool, especially for beginners, internalizing the best practices in which to code. Following a coding standard can help make code do all of these points and if practiced efficiently can turn you into a better developer. This essay explores the importance of using a coding standard using my personal experiences and research I've done along the way using a coding standard. 

## More Than Just Formatting

You may think coding standards are just used for formatting and for stylistic choices but it can be used in many other ways. One way is to influence and maintain coding quality. By following these standards we can enforce the bet practices that prevent common mistakes, promote readability, and also facilitate collaboration. Improving our quality will also reduce the amount of work load needed to understand yours and other developers code. 

## As a Learning Tool

Following coding standards prove useful as a learning tool for all developers. By writing code that adheres to the standards it will give us a larger understanding of the syntax, coding structure, as well as logic. Coding standards can also help developers, especially beginners, to learn and avoid bad coding habits be following the guidelines. For example using the ESLint tool will not only catch errors but also give a brief explanation for developers so that they can understand the reasoning behind each error. 

## Experiences Using ESLint

In my experience using ESLint has help me to become a much more efficient coder. Although initially at first it was frustrating seeing all the red text over my code, it showed me that what I thought was good code actually did not follow the standard. This made me in turn reflect and learn what my errors was. Fixing these errors helped me in the long run as now I am aware of the standards and how to fix them so I can implement them in the future. Using ESLint as an educational tool can help developers follow a standard useful for everyone.

## Summary

Coding standards are the backbone of good software engineering. Although in a solo project, in a professional/collaborative setting it reduces technical errors and also makes debugging easier making the process smoother and faster. Not only is coding standards good for a group setting but also individually. As it improves ones own coding skills and improves quality making you a much more worthy developer especially when trying to land an interview. Embracing coding standards, especially earlier on in your developing career, can help you foster a mindset of discipline, clarity, and efficiency, leading you into being a more rounded developer.
