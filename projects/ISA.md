## About
International Student Organization, or ISA, is a social organization made for local and international students. The focus of this club is to help and encourage students to socialize with each other by providing a safe space that all cultures and diversities can join without discrimination. This helps to promote their culture and interest to further improve their insight upon local and international students. For me it showed me exactly what this club promoted, I was able to learn about various cultures and made friends that came from all over the world.

## What I learned
As an officer in this organization, I was given the task of helping lead the members and making sure everyone felt included and had fun. I contributed to this club by helping with planning activities, external/internal problems, and being the face of the club. I worked with a wonderful team that helped inspire me and showed me how to work in a professional environment. Together we were able to overcome obstacles that we faced during our term and grow from them. 

## Summary
During my term working in the organization, I learned how to manage a schedule filled with tasks I had to do but also keep an insight into what can or may go wrong during an event that I have responsibility for. Itâ€™s through these experiences I learned how to respond in a swift moral manner to situations that cannot be fixed. I also learned how to work with a team and how to be a good, convincing leader.
