## About
In my ICS 314 course me and a couple of other students were assigned to work on a school-related problem. The problem me and my group decided to work on was that at our university's gym, Warrior Recreation Center, we found that it was hard for students to get a chance to play and reserve a spot at open court rec volleyball/basketball. So in order to tackle this problem we decided to create an application that fixes this problem, creating a hub where interested players can sign up for time slots to play and look at the current score of the current game.

## What I Provided
In the beginning of our team’s planning, I was able to help lead our team towards the right path. I was able to effectively communicate with the other members to gather our thoughts on our idea and how we would be able to tackle it. Whether it’s through creating needed discord meetings, creating a hub where we could keep track of the different milestones and create notes, as well as help in our coding effort. 

## What I Learned
During this experience I was able to go through many problems and learned how to solve it. I learned that in a team setting it is essential for communication among the group members so that there is no overlap between everyone and so everyone knows exactly what they need to do and what is going on. I also learned and refined various software engineering skills like; React, HTML, TypeScript, Node.js, PgAdmin, and Vercel. This experience of going through these problems together with my team not only showed me the importance of each skill, but also gave me a stronger sense of these skills. I am happy with the turn out of this project and look forward brightly towards the future applying these skills and experience to further more challenging projects.
