## About

M.A.G. club, or Manga Anime Gaming Club is a social club made for everyone who enjoys manga, anime, and or gaming. The main focus of this club was to help students with same interest to come together and socialize to make more friends and have a good time. During the time people were being reticulated for enjoying Manga and Anime so this club provided a safe place for people who enjoyed it. For me I did not care about the backlash and enjoyed talking and playing games with everyone who also enjoyed manga, anime, and games 

## What I learned

I willingly took the position of President for this club. Going into this was a big learning curve for me as previously I was only a member and had no prior experience with any leadership position. My term was during the outbreak of covid so I had a massive hurtle to overcome with people not being able to meet physically. Even with my inexperience and external problems I was able to lead my team and the members into an amazing school year that accommodated the covid restrictions and everyone's schedule. 

## Summary

During my term I learned how to manage an organization. I learned various essential skills like time management, leadership, and being responsible. I was able to push beyond and gain self confidence in my self and was able to learn how to imply my mindset onto others in an ethical manner and come up with a unified conclusion.
