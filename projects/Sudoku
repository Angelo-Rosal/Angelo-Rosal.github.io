## About

This was a project that I created that helps solve given Sodoku problems. In this project I used various algorithms to help solve any Sodoku problem and checks to see if it is valid. The program is designed to solve the given problem and return the problem and solution. 

## Reflection

In this project I used various parameters and minor recursion to fullfill its duty. First I used a wide array of if statements in order to find if the problem is valid. I also used recursion to find the solution to the problem by calling itself and checking to see a valid input. 

In this project my knowledge of Java greatly increased as it improved my insight to how recursion works and uses various Java syntax that will deem useful in future projects.
